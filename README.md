# Overview

As a beginning Software Engineer, one of my goals is to expand my field of knowledge.  Understanding, experimenting and creating 
new programs and applications is a challenging but exciting endeavor.  In this program, I wanted to expand my 
knowledge of Kotlin, and have developed this program to improve that skill.

This application was written in the Kotlin language.  It is a Task Manager that can add, remove and list tasks.

My purpose for writing this software in to further understand the Kotlin language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
